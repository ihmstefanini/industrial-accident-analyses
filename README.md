Exploratory Analyses of Industrial Labor Accidents using Python Notebook


# Motivation
Did you know that a lot of accidents happen every day in manufacturing plants?
Did you also know that it kill thousands of people everywhere, globally?


# Objective
Analyse real labor accident data aiming to help manufacturing plants to save lives.
This notebook does not intend to use any machine learning technique, but to help people to take valuable insights from few lines of data


# Few simple Concepts to learn
We will use two basic concepts about data exploration: Highlight and Insight
 - **Highlight**: when we resume data information (you will see examples throught the notebook)
 - **Insight**: ideas and questions that come from the Highlights


# Further details
 - Programming Language for data analysis: **Python**
 - Data handling tools: **pandas** helping with data-frame operations
 - Data Visualization tools: **Seaborn and Plotly**
